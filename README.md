# Project Name: Advanced RabbitMQ Messaging

## Overview
This project demonstrates an advanced implementation of RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging in a Spring Boot application. Designed with scalability and efficiency in mind, it allows for robust message handling in distributed systems, ensuring reliable communication between microservices.

### Key Features:
- Asynchronous messaging with RabbitMQ
- Integration with Spring Boot and JPA for database operations
- Dynamic routing using topic exchanges
- Serializable object messaging
- Error handling and message requeueing strategies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- RabbitMQ Server
- Optional: Docker for containerization

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/scriptchief/rabbitmq-spring.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd advanced-rabbitmq-spring
   ```
3. Build the project with Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

### Running the Application
1. Start the RabbitMQ server on your local machine or use a Docker container.
2. Run the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## Usage
The application exposes REST APIs to interact with the RabbitMQ server for CRUD operations on `Product` entities.

- **Create a Product**: Send a POST request to `/api/products` with a product JSON.
- **Read Product Details**: Send a GET request to `/api/products/{id}`.
- **Update a Product**: Send a PUT request to `/api/products/{id}` with the updated product JSON.
- **Delete a Product**: Send a DELETE request to `/api/products/{id}`.

## Architecture
- **Producer Service**: Handles incoming REST requests and sends messages to RabbitMQ.
- **Consumer Service**: Listens to RabbitMQ messages and processes them (e.g., database operations).
- **RabbitMQ Configuration**: Defines queues, exchanges, and bindings.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing advanced RabbitMQ features like dead-letter exchanges, delayed messaging, and priority queues.
- Adding containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes.
- Integrating with a frontend framework for a full-stack application.
